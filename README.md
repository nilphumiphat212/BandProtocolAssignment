# Broadcasting Transaction Client Module Documentation

The Broadcasting Transaction Client Module provides a simple way to create, broadcast, and check the status of transactions using the Band Protocol. This module is designed to work with the nilphumiphat.assignment.bandprotocol/pkg/transaction package.

## Installation
To use the Broadcasting Transaction Client Module, you need to have the nilphumiphat.assignment.bandprotocol/pkg/transaction package already available in your Go project. If not, please ensure that you have the necessary package installed or defined.

## Usage

Import the necessary packages in your Go code:
'''go
import (
	"fmt"
	"nilphumiphat.assignment.bandprotocol/pkg/transaction"
	// Other necessary packages
)
'''

Create a new transaction using the NewTransaction function from the transaction package:
'''go
transaction := transaction.NewTransaction("ETH", 50000)
'''

Broadcast the transaction using the Broadcast method:
'''go
data, err := transaction.Broadcast()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Broadcast failed:", err)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Broadcast successful. Transaction hash:", data.TxHash)
}
'''

Check the status of the transaction using the CheckStatus method:
'''go
status, err := transaction.CheckStatus()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Status check failed. Please check your network connection.")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Status:", status.Status)
    fmt.Println("Transaction:", status.Message)
}
'''

# Transaction Status Handling
The Broadcasting Transaction Client Module handles transaction statuses as follows:

## Broadcasting Transaction:
    If the broadcasting is successful, the transaction hash is provided.
    If there's an error during broadcasting, an error message is displayed.
## Checking Transaction Status:
    If the status check is successful, the transaction's current status and an associated message are displayed.
    If there's an error during the status check (such as network connectivity issues), an error message is displayed.
